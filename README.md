This repository consists of a few small experiments with procedurally generated Sokoban levels.
To try a level yourself, run procoban_prototype.py and play with the WASD keys.

Note that this is very unpolished (I'm only really working on the level generation), and thus is missing many features you might want or expect (e.g. an undo button, better graphics). It'll sometimes produce a dud level (e.g. can be solved in 1 move), so I recommend trying at least 3 or 4 levels to get a sense of the sort of level it outputs.

Algorithm (very) loosely based off of the following excellent paper: https://ianparberry.com/pubs/GAMEON-NA_METH_03.pdf
